# SchoolsDashboard
The Schools Dashboard is an expansion on the Schools Database which expands the data availability beyond what is known about schools. 

## Schools Database
The Schools Database is designed to enable an in depth understanding of schools, and other educational establishments, across Greater Manchester and their engagement with sport and physical activity. The Database aims to share both publicly available data and project/programme specific data direct from deliverers. Whilst some of this information is available in the public domain it is often difficult to get a clear picture of wider engagement or how this impacts the educational landscape as a whole, as well as how projects link. The Schools Database enables a more in-depth picture to be generated of individual schools as well as specific areas. This will ultimately enable the wealth of information surrounding schools and their engagement with sport and physical activity to be shared and to encourage collaboration between partners whilst enabling more targeted approaches for new and existing projects and programmes whilst allowing for the exploration of learnings.

## Schools Dashboard
The Dashboard utilises all the information available in the Database and joins it with publically available datasets
relating to children and young people, health and wellbeing. Through maps and graphs the Schools Dashboard is designed
to enable partners to understand and utilise the data available and to inform decision making at all levels in the system.
